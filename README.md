# bobbbay.github.io is unavailable.

I actually don't use this. the only reason I have a `_config.yml` here is simply because I have [bobbbay.github.io/blog](https://bobbbay.github.io/blog/), which requires `/assets/main.css`, thanks to Jekyll. GitHub integration with Jekyll allows me to have a Jekyll-formatted YLM config file, and the rest will come. 

I have currently have no plans on working on this, for the moment. Maybe one day, I'll be able to pick this up. For now, check out my blog and stay tuned!
